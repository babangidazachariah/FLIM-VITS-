# Fuzzy Logic-based Intersection Management using V2X 
The challenge of road traffic delays persist even with various modern solutions that have been proposed. Thus, this research proposes a Fuzzy Logic-based solution that takes advantage of the Vehicle-to-Everthing (V2X) communication. The research resulted in two publications, which are listed below.

    A Hybrid Autonomous Intersection Management for Minimizing Delays Using Fuzzy Logic 
    <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. This paper proposes the fuzzy logic approach for minimization of traffic delays relying on connected vehicles. The assessment of the performance of the approach against static/fixed-time approaches and a recently proposed approach on an isolated intersection was performed and results show significant improvement of our approach at minimizing delays and improving throughput.
