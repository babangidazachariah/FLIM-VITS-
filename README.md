# Fuzzy Logic-based Intersection Management using V2X 
The challenge of road traffic delays persist even with various modern solutions that have been proposed. Thus, this research proposes a Fuzzy Logic-based solution that takes advantage of the Vehicle-to-Everthing (V2X) communication. The research resulted in two publications, which are listed below.
<ol>
  <li>
    A Hybrid Autonomous Intersection Management for Minimizing Delays Using Fuzzy Logic 
    <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. 
    This paper proposes the fuzzy logic approach for minimization of traffic delays relying on connected vehicles. The assessment of the performance of the approach against static/fixed-time approaches and a recently proposed approach on an isolated intersection was performed and results show significant improvement of our approach at minimizing delays and improving throughput.

  <li>
    Minimizing Network-wide Traffic Delays For Priority Vehicles Using I2I Communication <a href="ref2">[2]</a>. 
    This paper extends the previous paper <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> to allow for multi-intersection communication to minimize delays both for non-priority and high-priority vehicles in a traffic network. The assessment of the proposed approach against the regular preemptive approach shows that our proposed approach achieved better performance, minimizing delays and improving throughput.

</ol>

The combined results obtained in <a href="ref1">[1]</a> and <a href="ref2">[2]</a> produced the thesis that partially fulfilled the requirements for the award of Masters of Applied Science (MASc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Thesis Title: "Fuzzy Logic-Based Intersection Management for Delay Minimization in Intelligent Transportation Systems Using V2X Communication" <a href="ref3">[3]</a>.
